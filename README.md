My personal web page
This is my first web page where I will document all the work I have done during my time between three communities in Madison, Wisconsin; Oaxaca, Mexico; and Long Beach, California.

I have a wide background of work history ranging from working with infants, todlers, elementary kids, middle school and high school youth, adults, parents. Worked in warehouses, restaurants, retails, and non-profits.
